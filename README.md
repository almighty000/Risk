Game Properties:
*The Risk board has 6 continents — North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Australian Archipelago — and 42 countries.
* The Risk armies come in six basic colors, along with different kinds of tokens, denoting size of the army. Each set has Infantry (which represents 1 “army”), Cavalry (5 armies), and Artillery (10 armies).
* A pack of 56 Risk cards should be included. 42 cards are marked with countries as well as an infantry, cavalry, or artillery symbol. There are two "Wild" cards, and 12 "Mission" cards that come with the Secret Mission Risk variant. There should be five dice (three red and two white). //We will add it later.
* Players and Armies:
6 players - 20 armies each
5 players - 25 armies each
4 players - 30 armies each
3 players - 35 armies each
2 players - 40 armies each



*Public Methods: 

1)Need to create a method that will  return 2 values of rolling dice and the greater/winning number
2) a method that returns the number of army after each turn a player gets. *How:* For every three countries, the player gets one army. For example, if you had 11 countries, you would receive 3 armies; if you had 22 countries, you would receive 7 armies.if the amount of armies you would receive at the beginning of your turn is less than three, round up to three.
3) a method that returns if the user has a set of card (3 of a same card) or not.
